Description
===========

_goPy_transform.py
------------------

File ./src/_goPy_transform.py was modified in order to transform excel files to to the orange ones. This script eliminates white spaces, tabs, accents and lowercase all the symbols, substitutes commas to tabs, like task 6 states.

assoc1.py
---------

File ./src/assoc1.py was implemented( was gotten from the orange off site and modified ) to get rules given specific attributes such as confidence, support etc.
But All we needed is to create report using Orange graphical components: 

    Data:File -> Associate:Association Rules -> Associate:Association Rules Explorer

and click report=)
